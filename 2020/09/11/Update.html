    11 Sep 2020- <a href="/members/roper.html">Gabriel Roper</a></p>

<p>Background research has been proceeding at a steady pace. Over the past week, we found a number of research papers and
patents that are relevant to our project. A summary of what the sources cover has been uploaded to the documents section.
Additionally, we received feedback from our tech writing professor on our style guide. We have fixed the problems with
and added it to the documents page as well.</p>

<p>Over the next week we will be developing some rough concepts for the robotâ€™s design. Furthermore, we will soon be
posting an updated version of the requirements document, which will have the spelling and grammar mistakes fixed.</p>
