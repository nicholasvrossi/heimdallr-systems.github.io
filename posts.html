        <h2><a href="/2020/10/23/Kinematics.html">Kinematic Progress</a></h2>
        <p>As before, we have been chugging along with our work. This past week, made a decent bit of headway on the kinematics
of the robot. Nick has been leading the charge on this, and has completed the forward kinematic calculations, and the
inverse kinematics for the legs. Additionally, he is almost done developing the inverse kinematic equations for
how the robot will control the tilt of its body. Once complete, he intends to develop some basic kinematic equations
to help the robot maintain static stability.</p>


    </li><li>
        <h2><a href="/2020/10/16/Update.html">Chugging along</a></h2>
        <p>Work on the preliminary design has continued at a steady pace. The basic forward kinematics have been worked out, and
Nick has begun developing the inverse kinematic equations. Trevor has been working on implementing basic walking
simulations in MATLAB. Alex is handling CAD work for both of these projects, while Gabe is learning how ROS works,
to hopefully use it to implement a simulation by the end of the semester.</p>

    </li><li>
        <h2><a href="/2020/10/09/Update.html">Beginning of the Prelim Work</a></h2>
        <p>As of Monday the team has finished up the the near continuous presentations on our concept, and begun actual work on the 
project. We have created a preliminary schedule for the work that we will be doing for the rest of the semester, and 
split the tasks up amongst ourselves based on what skills we each have. Currently, work is being done on a preliminary
CAD model, developing kinematic equations for the robot, and selecting the main computer and sensors that the robot will 
use.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/10/02/Update.html">Nearing the end of the planning sprint</a></h2>
        <p>This past week we presented on our team conceptual design to the class, and unveiled our new legged concept. There
was some questions regarding our decision of 4 legs, as it did not entirely line up with our decision matrix, but we
managed to clear most of them up. We have starting working on writing preliminary testing criteria, and will be
presenting them on Monday. Once that is complete, we will have finished up our core planning work, and can get started
on a actually working on the design of the robot, and simulating it in high-fidelity.</p>

    </li><li>
        <h2><a href="/2020/09/25/Update.html">Continued Conceptual Design</a></h2>
        <p>This past week we finished up the individual conceptual design presentations, and we began work on our group conceptual
design that we will be presenting on Monday. One big change that was made was a decision to move towards a four leg
design, as it will give the robot more multi-terrain capabilities. However, the robot will still have a way to have
motorized wheels attached to it to it, so that it can travel at higher speeds on prepared surfaces.</p>


    </li><li>
        <h2><a href="/2020/09/18/Update.html">The beginning of conceptual design.</a></h2>
        <p>This past week all of the team members developed their own independent proposals for how the robot will accomplish the
requirements that we had previously decided on. We began presenting on these concepts today, with Trevor and Alex
presenting their concepts to the class. On Monday, Nick and I will be presenting our concepts. Once those presentations
have been finished, they will be uploaded to the site.</p>

    </li><li>
        <h2><a href="/2020/09/11/Update.html">Second Weekly Update</a></h2>
        <p>Background research has been proceeding at a steady pace. Over the past week, we found a number of research papers and
patents that are relevant to our project. A summary of what the sources cover has been uploaded to the documents section.
Additionally, we received feedback from our tech writing professor on our style guide. We have fixed the problems with
and added it to the documents page as well.</p>


    </li><li>
        <h2><a href="/2020/09/04/Update.html">First Update</a></h2>
        <p>As we just started on the project this past week, not much has happened. The website is pretty much done, and we have a
first pass on the requirements document. See it in the <em>Documents</em> section on on this website.</p>
